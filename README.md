# Reverse-Engineering-Icecream-Scoop
The objective of this project was to reverse engineer any product. 
Reverse engineering is the process of breaking down a product into each of its specific parts and make any one aspect/part more efficient or affective. 
The traditional icecream scoop was used as the product to be reverse engineered. 
I have attached all the 3D modeled parts, the final assembly as well as renders of the final product. 
Moreover, a tenchincal report is also attached explaining the significance of the imporved design.
